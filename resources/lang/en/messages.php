					                The survey and process have been designed so that your response will be kept confidential and anonymous. </p>

					               <p> Please note that your participation in this survey is entirely voluntary. Any data you provide will be stored and maintained by Ascent Partners Group Limited on its server located in the United States. By participating in this survey, you understand and agree that your answers will be submitted to Ascent Partners Group Limited, who will collect the data and report them back to "[Company]" in a manner designed to preserve your anonymity to be further processed and analyzed by "[Company]". While the survey process have been designed so that your response will be kept confidential and anonymous, your identity may be inferred where you choose to insert free text comments or provide other identifying material within your response.

					           		<p>
					                As the survey will be conducted electronically, we kindly ask you to also take note of the following risks associated with electronic communication: Please note that data that is transported over an open network, such as the internet or email, may be accessible by third parties. Ascent Partners Group Limited cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted via such open networks. When disclosing any personal information via an open network, you should remain mindful of the fact that it is potentially accessible to others, and consequently, can be collected and used by other without your consent. In particular, while individual data packets are often encrypted, the information of the sender and recipient are not. A third party may therefore infer the existence of a relationship.
