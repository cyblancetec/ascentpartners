Dear Stakeholder,<br>
<br>
As a valued stakeholder to your organization, we kindly invite you to participate in the {{ date('Y') }} {{ $company }} Stakeholder Survey.<br>
<br>
{{ $company }} is currently conducting a review and refresh of their existing Materiality Assessment. We feel a robust assessment will effectively enable {{ $company }} <br>
to prioritize and report on corporate responsibility issues that are most important and impactful to both stakeholders and {{ $company }}. <br>
As such, we are conducting a short survey among stakeholder groups in order to supplement our previous findings.<br><br>

The results of the materiality assessment will be shared as part of {{ $company }}'s ESG Report.<br><br>

The survey and process have been designed so that your response will be kept confidential and anonymous.<br><br>

Please click below to start the survey.<br><br>

We thank you for your time and interest. Should you have any questions regarding the survey, please do not hesitate to contact Ascent Partners. <br><br>

Best regards,<br>
Ascent Partners ESG Team<br><br>
